Before computing the manual registration in ITK we need to create the "source" file
1. Export the .fmr as nifti in BrainVoyager
2. Compute t-mean operation [3_tmean_FSL in AOM-prject/CMRR_analysis]

In ITK-SNAP:
1. manual registration 
2. automatic affine registration (Coars x2, Fine x1)
3. Save initial_matrix_ITK.txt in func/alignment_ANTs folder
